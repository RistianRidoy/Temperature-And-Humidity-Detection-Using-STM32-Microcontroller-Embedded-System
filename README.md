# Temperature-And-Humidity-Measure-With-STM32F1-Microcontroller

The Microcontroller Unit (MCU) is a critical component of embedded system architecture. The STM32 microcontroller offers one of the best ecosystems, supporting various programmer kits and peripherals such as sensors, displays, and keypads to operate simultaneously. For our embedded system project that detects temperature and humidity, we will utilize the STM32 along with its peripherals. Specifically, we have selected the STM32F103C8T6 - Blue Pill as the primary MCU. Instead of an LCD module, we will use an I2C OLED display, along with the temperature and humidity sensors and a buzzer with red LED. Connections will be made using the jumper wires and a breadboard. STM32CubeIDE will be used for programming the system and ST Link V2 will be used to inject that programming code onto the microcontroller.
  In this project, we are dedicated to developing and constructing an embedded system centered on the STM32F103C8T6 - Blue Pill microcontroller, designed to accurately measure the humidity and temperature levels in the surrounding air using dedicated sensor DHT11 Temperature and Relative Humidity Sensor Module. The microcontroller serves as the core processing unit, managing the acquisition of environmental data. For enhanced and reliable electrical connections, we soldered the microcontroller pins. Instead of LEDs, our system integrates a buzzer that emits a beep when the temperature exceeds 35 degrees Celsius, providing an audible alert and the red LED bulb will glow. The temperature readings, along with highest and lowest temperature, are supposed to be displayed in both Celsius ('C') and Fahrenheit ('F'), with humidity readings, of which all are shown to the nearest one decimal point. The sensor data is presented on an I2C OLED display, establishing a practical and responsive solution for real-time monitoring and responding to environmental conditions.
